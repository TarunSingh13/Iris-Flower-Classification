> **Task 2** of my **Artificial Intelligence Internship** at **DecodeLabs**.

This project demonstrates a complete **Machine Learning Classification Pipeline** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm on the famous **Iris Dataset**. The project follows a modular architecture and covers every major step of a supervised learning workflow—from data loading to model evaluation and interactive prediction.

# 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify Iris flowers into one of the following species:

- 🌸 Setosa
- 🌼 Versicolor
- 🌺 Virginica

The classifier is trained using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm and includes preprocessing, evaluation, visualization, model persistence, and user-driven prediction.
